\section{Thesis Outline}

Chapter~\ref{Background}, provides some background information on the field of soft robotics, an introduction to genetic algorithms, different encoding techniques for the genomes, neuroevolution algorithms, and finally, objective driven search is presented and compared to novelty search. In Chapter~\ref{Related Work}, related material about evolutionary techniques for evolution of soft-robots morphology and locomotion is presented, in aspects of artificial life. Chapter~\ref{Method}, is a comprehensive documentation presenting details of the implementation of different evolutionary techniques. Chapter~\ref{Results}, gives a detailed presentation of the results achieved under variant techniques. Next, in chapter~\ref{Future Work}, future applications and extensions of this work provided. Chapter~\ref{Conclusion}, serves as an epilogue to this thesis, where some important points of it are presented.
