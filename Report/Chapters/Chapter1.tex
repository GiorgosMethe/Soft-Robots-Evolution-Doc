\section{Thesis Outline}

Chapter~\ref{Background} provides some background information on the field of soft robotics, an introduction to genetic algorithms, different encoding techniques for the genome, neuro-evolution algorithms, finally, objective driven search is presented and compared to novelty search. In Chapter~\ref{Related Work}, related material about evolutionary techniques for evolution of soft-robots morphology and locomotion is presented. Chapter~\ref{Conclusion} serves as an epilogue to this thesis, where some important points of it are presented.
