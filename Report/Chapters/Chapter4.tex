In this chapter, an introduction to the problem specifications and a comprehensive documentation describing the methods used is given. As an initial experiment, a random methodology has been implemented to verify that random non-evolutionary approaches fail in such settings. Next, evolutionary methods are used in order the morphology and the locomotion strategy of soft-robots to be co-evolved in the simulated environment. A direct encoding genetic algorithm is used as in~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}. This direct encoding is expected to be unable to evolve efficient locomotion due to the irregular morphologies direct encoding is expected to produce. Furthermore, a generative encoding, named CPPN, is used and paired with NEAT evolutionary algorithm in order a baseline for the following experiments will be created, verifying previous work~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}.

Novelty search is the main methodology investigated in this thesis. The implementation of this method alters the pipeline of the NEAT evolutionary algorithm to fit the new objective function. Pure novelty search used to evolve three dimensional virtual creatures in a simulated environment~\citep{lehman2011evolving}, using a behavior metric such as the morphology of the produced creature, failed to compete with the traditional fitness-based search. In addition to the discussion regarding the above method, behavior metrics can be used in this problem domain are investigated. 



\section{Problem Introduction}

Recent work in evolutionary robotics shows that compositional pattern producing networks (CPPNs) can encode soft-robot morphologies. These networks can produce regular outputs which is translated to regular shapes for the structures produced, resulting in efficient movement. VoxCad simulator provides a test-bench for analyzing soft-robot bodies that can be actuated through environmental changes, in the specific case the temperature. In addition to that, recent work by~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}, showed that very interesting morphologies can be evolved by the CPPN-NEAT algorithm in the specific soft-robot simulation environment.

\paragraph*{VoxCad}~\\

For the simulation of the soft material bodies, VoxCad's~\citep{hiller2012dynamic} underlying physics engine \emph{Voxelyze} was used as a stand-alone software to analyze the soft structures without the computational cost of rendering. As far as the soft-material simulation settings are concerned, it is not of interest for this thesis to explore the best not only environmental but also material settings for the evolved soft-robots. All variables of the environment, excluding the temperature period and the gravity acceleration, are constants throughout this thesis. Table~\ref{VoxelyzeSimulationSettings}, describes and presents the values used in different variables of the simulation.



\paragraph*{Materials}~\\

\caption{Soft robot uses four materials (two active, two passive), morphology evolved penalizing actuated materials.}
\label{fig:allSoftMaterials}
\end{figure}

Within the VoxCad simulation software there is the option of defining and using a palette of materials. Materials can be \emph{passive} or \emph{active}. Passive materials do not react to temperature changes while active materials expand and contract in respect to their thermal properties. Figure~\ref{fig:allSoftMaterials}, illustrates a soft robot consisting of all four materials used in the experiments. \textcolor{Red}{Red} and \textcolor{Green}{Green} are the only actuated materials with non-zero and opposite thermal expansion coefficients, meaning that their phase in respect to the actuation from temperature changes is equal to half a circle, green voxels contract the same time red expand and vice versa, mimicking living organisms' muscle tissue. The two additional materials represent soft non-actuated tissue that can be soft (soft tissue) or hard (bones). \textcolor{Cyan}{Cyan} voxels are soft, having five times smaller elastic modulus of their material than \textcolor{Blue}{Blue} which have $50$ \texttt{MPa}.


\section{Random Generation of Soft-Robots}

To evaluate all the following evolutionary methods used, information about the performance of random generated morphologies must be present. In order to achieve that, two random approaches which will also help the understanding between direct and indirect encoding implemented. 

The first implementation of a random morphology generator mimics ``direct'' encoding. This method assigns randomly the presence of a voxel in the three dimensional space of the lattice. The probability of adding a voxel in given coordinates is $0.5$. The material of each presented voxel is chosen a random material from the palette. Each material has the same propability of being chosen. After all voxels have been assigned a material, unconnected parts of of the structure will be removed, keeping only the largest connected structure in the lattice.


\begin{figure}

\caption{Generative encoding creates more natural morphologies even in random schemes (see Settings~\ref{Settings-size10}).}
\label{fig:randomResultsRobots}
\end{figure}

An ``indirect'' way of producing random morphologies, follows a different method of assigning materials to voxels, following a set of rule in order a new morphology to be produced. This method holds two probabilities, the one refers to the probability of adding a new voxel in the already generated structure, the next one denotes the probability that the material of a new inserted voxel will be the same as the one of the material is going to be connected to. First, a random material voxel is inserted in a random coordinate into the lattice. When a new voxel is to be added, a connection (voxel) is chosen from the already inserted voxels. The side of the connection is chosen from a uniform distribution out of all valid (within the lattice space) sides. In this generative process there is also the possibility of creating structures in half of the lattice space, and then mirror the soft structures in both halves of it, generating symmetrical morphologies.

Considering these three methods, the difference between direct and indirect coding, presented in section~\ref{DirectIndirect}, is becoming easier interpreted. In the ``direct'' process, a probability determines the presence and the material of every voxel in the lattice. On the other hand, in the ``generative'' method a set of rules and probabilities define the structure that is going to be produced into the available space.

Figure~\ref{fig:randomResultsRobots}, illustrates not only the actual performance (fitness in body lengths traveled by top-$1000$ soft-robots from $30000$ total runs for each method) of the previously described methods, but also one of the best performing soft-robots of each method. Both ``generative'' methods outperform the ``direct'' one, mostly because they are capable of generating regular morphologies. ``Generative'' random soft-robot generation methods create more compact structures which can move easier due to their size and their geometrical features. For the \textit{Generative-Mirrored} approach even though the average performance is slightly worse than the plain method it actually performs way better in some distinct cases (outliers). Adding geometrical properties resulted in getting more efficient locomotion by the generated soft-robots.

All methods achieved an average displacement of the soft-robots around or more than one body length, which is considered to be very low in respect to the robots generated by evolutionary methods will be presented later in this thesis.

\section{Direct-Encoded Evolutionary Soft-Robots}
\label{DirectEncodingEvolution}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.2\textheight]{../Figures/Robots/direct.jpg}
\caption{Direct encoding cannot capture the geometrical properties of some problems.}
\label{fig:directRobot}
\end{figure}

In the previous section, three random methodologies of ``indirect'' and ``direct'' generation of soft-robots implemented, failing to produce any decent locomotion gaits for the soft structures. Considering how vast is the solution space, random approaches are doomed to fail in a definite number of tries. Therefore, a more sophisticated evolutionary method is discussed here.

Direct encoding genomes coupled with a simple genetic algorithm is a successful approach in evolving robot controllers. As it was previously stated in ch.~\ref{Background}, mutations and crossovers of real value streams, search the problem space effectively finding near optimal solutions in demanding optimization problem domains. The GAlib C++ library \citep{wall1996galib} is used for the implementation of this method.

\paragraph*{Representation of the genotype}~\\
As in every direct encoding scheme, genotype can be represented by a stream of bits, which length is equal to the number of the dimensions of the problem. The capacity of the materials' palette is the first dimensions of the problem. The presence or not of a material at a given position in the lattice space adds one more dimension to the representation. Analytically, its length can be represented by a stream of length equal to the number of voxels in the lattice times the materials used plus one denoting the presence of a material, described by the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{lengthDirect}
| Genome | = (l_x \times l_y \times l_z ) \times (1 + |p|)
\end{equation}
, where $l_x, l_y, l_z$ are the dimensions of the lattice space, and $p$ is the palette of materials.
\begin{equation*}
Genome = \underbrace{01010\ldots011011}_\text{Presence}\ \    \underbrace{10101\ldots110011}_{Material_1} \   \ldots\  \underbrace{00011\ldots111110}_{Material_n}
\end{equation*}
The above stream of bit illustrates how a soft-structure in VoxCad environment can be represented by a direct encoding scheme. Each of the values of the stream is represented by a float value between zero and one, which in lower-level is represented by a stream of bits. The mapping from the genotype level to the phenotype is straightforward in this case, the first stream of values is used to determine the presence or not for a voxel, while in case of a presence the other $n$ streams are used and the maximum value in specific positions of the streams determine the material is going to be used.

Considering the representation of the genome, as well as the geometrical nature of the problem it self, it is valid to say that we do not expect that direct encoding will capture this major property of the problem (see Fig.~\ref{fig:directRobot}). Thus, it is not expected this stream of bits being able to generate soft-robots that can locomote efficiently.





\section{Generative-Encoded Evolutionary Soft-Robots}

Direct encoding methods lack the morphology regularities of the evolved soft-robots. Compositional pattern-producing networks (CPPNs), can serve this function. Compositional pattern producing networks are built up by a set of canonical functions which force the outputs of the network to produce repetitive, symmetrical and geometrically interesting patterns. Producing regularities in the phenotype space, and capturing geometrical properties of the optimization problem, it is expected to produce efficient locomotion strategies and morphologies of the soft structures~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}.
\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.2\textheight]{../Figures/Misc/cppnSoftBot.eps}
\caption{Each genotype is queried for every coordinate inside the lattice, its outputs determine the presence of a voxel and the type of its material.}
\label{fig:cppnDiagram}
\end{figure}
Since, CPPNs must be queried for every coordinate of the lattice space, the input nodes (neurons) of the CPPN are assigned to x,y,z normalized coordinates following~\citep{cheney2013unshackling} so that:
\[x,y,z \in [-1,1]\]
A bias input node is also introduced in the genome CPPN representation. More inputs could be added to the CPPNs, for instance the distance from the center point of the Cartesian space (simulation lattice) as described in~\citep{stanley2007compositional} and used in~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}, which naturally adds more bias towards symmetrical structures. However, evolving perfectly symmetrical structures is not much of an interest to show, since CPPNs, as it is shown later in this thesis, can evolve symmetrical morphologies without this extra information input node(s). The proposed input nodes for the three dimensions of the Cartesian space provide the minimum bias to the network outputs. Figure~\ref{fig:cppnDiagram}, illustrates the topology of a random CPPN network with the input and output nodes described above. The set of nodes and connections determine the network's \emph{topology}. The topology of these networks can be variant and be evolved alongside the weights of the connections in any neuroevolutionary method. The divergent part of the network between the input and the output nodes is described by the genotype and it is the one that is going to be evolved and altered during the evolution. The presence or not of a voxel in each coordinate of the lattice is determined by a single output of the CPPN called $p$ and the selection of the material is determined by $n$-outputs. The node with the maximum value in the output will determine which of the materials will be used.

\subsection{How CPPNs can be evolved?}

The evolution of these indirect representations of the phenotypes can be evolved with any method able to evolve artificial neural networks, since they are identical with CPPNs. CPPN-NEAT (see Section~\ref{CPPN}), is a method of evolving CPPNs within NEAT evolutionary method. Previous work~\citep{cheney2013unshackling}, showed that this method can indeed evolve the morphologies of the soft-robots in the VoxCad simulation environment. HyperNEAT\footnote{HyperNEAT \texttt{v4.0 C++} by J. Gauci code (url: \url{https://github.com/MisterTea/HyperNEAT})} was used for the implementation of the CPPN-NEAT algorithm. Algorithm~\ref{evolutionPseudocode}, presents the pseudocode for the evolution under CPPN-NEAT method. In addition, a brief explanation of each function used in the algorithm follows:


\begin{algorithm}[t!]
\caption{CPPN-NEAT evolution}
\label{evolutionPseudocode}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE $\mathtt{population} = \varnothing$
\STATE $\mathtt{species} = \varnothing$
\STATE $\mathtt{generation}[0] = \mathbf{initial\_population}()$
\FOR{ $i = 0\   \text{to}\  \mathtt{max\_generation}$}
\STATE $\mathtt{species} = \mathtt{species} \cup \mathbf{speciation}(\mathtt{generation}[i])$

\STATE $\mathtt{generation}[i+1] = \mathbf{reproduction}(\mathtt{generation}[i])$
\STATE $\mathtt{population} = \mathtt{population} \cup \mathtt{generation}[i+1]$
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{description}
\item[Initial population]{Before the evolution starts, an initial population must be produced, identical genomes (CPPNs), with variant connection weights fill up the population.}

\item[Speciation]{Takes place and split the population in separate species or adds individuals to already existing species in respect to their networks' topologies (a compatibility function determines the similarity between two genomes, equation~\ref{CompatibilityEquation}). However, all firstly introduced genomes belong to the same species, due to the identical topology of their CPPNs.}

\item[Evaluation] Once the population is filled with new individuals, these have to be evaluated. Simulation is take place for each of the individuals of the population, where each one of them is awarded with a fitness value.

\item[Fitness adjustment]{After all individual are evaluated, each species is assigned a value which is the sum of the fitness values of the individuals belonging to the species divided by the number of the individuals. The way it is been decided how many individuals each of the species will breed is directly determined by the average fitness of each species.}

\item[Selection]{As soon as the number of new individual each species is determined, only the top $20\%$ of the species population will reproduce, the rest population will ``die''. \emph{Competition}, and \emph{Elitism} as other genetic selection techniques can also be used here.}

\item[Reproduction]{There are two ways, for the selected individual inside each species to reproduce. These are \emph{mutation}, which slightly changes the genome of one parent,  creating a new genome, and \emph{crossover}, where two parents combine their genes to create a new individual.}
\end{description}






\subsection{Novelty search}

Novelty search as first presented in Chapter~\ref{Background}, requires small changes in an evolutionary algorithm. Fitness is replaced by a novelty metric which determines how novel is a phenotype's behavior in respect to novel behaviors found earlier in the evolution. Sparsity (equation~\ref{sparsenessEquation}), is used to determine this value, where every individual is compared not only with the previous novel behaviors but also with the current generation's observed behaviors.

\STATE $\mathtt{population} = \mathtt{population} \cup \mathtt{generation}[i+1]$
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


The algorithmic adjustments within CPPN-NEAT algorithm are presented in Algorithm~\ref{noveltyPseudocode}, where the pseudocode of novelty search is presented.

Evaluation function in fitness-based evolution, was responsible of evaluating an individual in respect to an objective metric. This metric is the body lengths traveled by the soft-robot within a time span. However the same function is now also responsible of observing the behavior of each individual, and record it. In this way, the novelty of a behavior can be computed based on recorded behaviors of other individuals. Function \text{sparsity}, computes the sparseness (equation~\ref{sparsenessEquation}) of a specific individual's behavior in the behavioral space, calculating the mean distance from the $k$-closest behaviors. Following the evaluation of each individual, its behavior will be compared to all novel behaviors stored during the evolution. A threshold is determining if the observed behavior is considered novel in respect to the set of behaviors was compared against. The fitness adjustment of the previous code example is becoming novelty adjustment following the same functionality, selection and reproduction operations can be applied in the same fashion.

\emph{Behavior} can be defined as the way that a human/machine behaves towards or within an environment. Regarding the evolution of soft-robots in the specific simulated environment, behavior can be defined as the way soft-robots behave in respect to their locomotion strategy. Every aspect of the soft-robots movement that can be observed, can be used to describe their behavior. Previous work~\citep{lehman2011evolving}, in a try to evolve walking three dimensional virtual creatures, used the evolved morphology of the creatures to describe their behavior. Although, in this work comparing the morphology of the evolved soft-robots, is equal to comparing each individual's genotype (CPPN). Thus, only the comparison of the observed behavior in the phenotype level, can lead the evolution towards more complex behaviors.

A straightforward function that determines the goodness of an individual is used in fitness-based methods. This measure drives the search in ``good'' areas of the search space. However, the same measure cannot be used for novelty search. What novelty search seeks for is novelty in behavior space. It is expected that behaviors that contain information about the goodness (displacement) of individuals will be more successful than behaviors that other aspects of how the soft-robots behave. Novelty search drives the evolution towards unvisited behaviors. In cases that behavior does not contain information about the objective, the search for novelty will become random in regards to this objective function.

Behaviors that describe the morphology of the evolved soft-robots have failed~\citep{lehman2011evolving}, since search is then forcing new types of morphologies without caring about the actual target of the evolution, which was the efficient locomotion. To present a similar idea, consider a behavior metric that enumerates how many voxels the soft-robot is consisted of. This is not a well-founded behavior metric, since the search will reward new structures with different number of voxels from previous novel structures. There will not be exploration in the behavioral aspect that affects the actual target of the evolution which is to produce and evolve efficient locomotion strategies. 

Table~\ref{Behaviors}, presents all behaviors used for the novelty metric computation, with the sampling rate of the recorded values during the simulation and their description. For all recorder behavior metrics a constant sampling rate ensures that all signals have the same length. The behaviors used to describe the strategy and efficiency of the evolved morphologies' locomotion. They contain information that indirectly implies both of the objectives of the evolution. \emph{Trajectories} (2D and 3D), incorporate all the needed information, such as speed, displacement, and locomotion strategy. To avert from same trajectories in all possible directions, trajectories are normalized, meaning that their starting coordinate are always the start of the axes ($<0,0,0>$), and the coordinates of the trajectory are rotated so their center of mass is normalized to meet a specified angle ($\theta = 90^{o}$). To measure the the difference of two trajectories, the Euclidean distances between coordinates at the same sampling time are measured, so that:
\begin{align}
\text{First trajectory: } &t_i = t_i^1, t_i^2, \ldots, t_i^N\\
\text{Second trajectory: } &t_j = t_j^1, t_j^2, \ldots, t_j^N\\
\text{Difference: } &t_i - t_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} dist( t_i^n, t_j^n )
\end{align}
, where $n$ is the number of sampled coordinate points and $dist$ is the Euclidean distance. \emph{Pace} is also a very informative behavior metric as it directly measures the speed of the robot. \emph{Voxels touching the ground} can also produce information about the locomotion strategy but not enough about the actual performance regarding the displacement. Hopping robots that move fast can have same behaviors with hopping robots with zero speed. \emph{Maximum pressure} among the voxels' connection is one more behavior metric, pressure is expected to become higher as structures move faster and interactions with the ground eventually getting harder. Finally, \emph{maximum kinetic energy} is a different behavior that straightly determines the displacement of the voxels in the structure. To compute the difference between two signals a straightforward method is used. Subtracting the one signal from the other taking the absolute differences and sum them up to compute one single value that describes how variant the two signals are. More specifically:
\begin{align}
\text{First 1-d signal: } &s_i = s_i^1, s_i^2, \ldots, s_i^N\\
\text{Second 1-d signal: } &s_j = s_j^1, s_j^2, \ldots, s_j^N\\
\text{Difference: } &s_i - s_j = \sum_{n=1}^{N} | s_i^n - s_j^n |
\end{align}

For all behaviors but trajectories, the Fourier profile of their signal can also be used as an observed behavior. This process of transformation of the one-dimensional signals into frequency space eliminates shifts of signals in the time-axis. The discrete Fourier transformation:
\begin{equation}
C_i^k = \sum_{n=1}^{N-1} s_i^n e^{-i 2 \pi k n/N}
\end{equation}
For the Fourier transformations of these signals, the first twenty coefficients are compared, and the summation of their absolute differences determines the difference of the two behaviors.
\begin{equation}
\text{Difference in frequency: } s_i - s_j = \sum_{k=0}^{R-1} | C_i^k - C_j^k |, R=20
\end{equation}

We have now defined, what is a behavior and how one behavior can be different from another one to be considered novel, behaviors that are considered to be novel are stored in a list helping in this way the evolution to avoid generating similar behaviors (Algorithm~\ref{noveltyPseudocode}).
