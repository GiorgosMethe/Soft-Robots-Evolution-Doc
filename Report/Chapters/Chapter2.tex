\section{Soft Robotics}

Soft robotics~\cite{trivedi2008soft, pfeifer2012challenges} is a vivid research field on the science and engineering aspects of soft materials in mobile machines. As the name suggests soft robots made completely of soft materials mimicking animals or animal-parts that consist of soft tissue (elephant trunk, tongue, worm, octapus, etc.). Having no rigid parts the degrees of freedom can be explode and the possible ways of motion can become very complicated. In traditional ``hard'' robotics joint and rigid parts can predefine a set of movements and sometimes restrict the robot's locomotion strategy for example in a specific gait. In soft robotics, the absence of rigid parts can on the one hand make it the design of a locomotion strategy extremely complicated, on the other hand though the gait alternatives are limitless. Considering also that soft materials can be more friendly than conventional robot materials to humans, human-robot interaction can become more safe~\cite{sanan2011continuum}.

Actuating soft materials can be done in many ways including pneumatic systems~\cite{ilievski2011soft, shepherd2011multigait}, hydraylic, internal body explosions, pressure tubes, temperature changes and others~\cite{laschi2012soft, seok2010peristaltic}. It may seem immature, nevertheless, soft robotics research field is growing fast.
