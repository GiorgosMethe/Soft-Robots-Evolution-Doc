Soft robotics is a vivid research field on the science and engineering aspects of soft materials in mobile machines. Recent development in soft robotics and evolutionary optimization have shown the ability to simultaneously evolve the morphology and locomotion of soft robots. Generative encoding coupled with neural evolution of augmented topologies shows promising results. Novelty search, unlike traditional optimization methods does not aim to optimize the objective but instead looks for novelty. Novelty search rewards diversity and leads to a  variety of solutions, mimicking natural evolution. Apart from the performance comparison between novelty and fitness based search, this thesis shows that new locomotion patterns can be produced by the former. Different types of selection algorithms for fitness and novelty based evolution are studied. In addition, a method to combine both is proposed. Finally, the performance objective-wise is tested under variant gravity conditions leading into a taxonomy of possible locomotion strategies given different gravity levels.
